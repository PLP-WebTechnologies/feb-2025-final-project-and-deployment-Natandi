        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          Accessible Zambia is a project dedicated to making it easier for
          people with disabilities to navigate everyday life. We’re creating a
          mobile app that maps out disabled-friendly locations such as shops,
          schools, clinics, and public spaces.

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          We want to remove the uncertainty that many disabled people face when
          going out. By providing reliable, community-driven information about
          accessible places, we aim to empower people to move freely and safely.

        <h2>What Makes a Location Accessible?</h2>
        <p>
          Accessibility means more than just having a ramp. We’re looking at a
          range of features that make places safer and easier to use for
          everyone, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Step-free entrances and exits</li>
          <li>Accessible toilets and restrooms</li>
          <li>Wide doorways for wheelchairs</li>
          <li>Elevators with Braille buttons</li>
          <li>Clear, visible signage for navigation</li>
          <li>Staff trained to assist people with disabilities</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Where You’ll Find Accessible Listings</h2>
        <p>
          The app will highlight accessible places across Zambia — from big
          cities like Lusaka and Ndola to smaller communities and towns. These
          may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Shopping malls and supermarkets</li>
          <li>Restaurants and cafés with step-free access</li>
          <li>Public clinics and hospitals with proper facilities</li>
          <li>Schools and training centers with inclusive environments</li>
          <li>Churches and places of worship with ramps and seating access</li>
          <li>Parks and outdoor recreation areas with paved paths</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Community Involvement</h2>
        <p>
          We believe the best way to build a useful resource is to work with the
          people who understand accessibility firsthand. That’s why we’re
          building tools that allow you to contribute to the platform — adding
          new places, uploading photos, and reviewing accessibility features
          based on your real experiences.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
        <p>
          Inaccessible environments lead to exclusion and isolation. Everyone
          deserves the freedom to explore, work, learn, and socialize without
          worrying about physical barriers. Accessible Zambia is one step toward
          building a more inclusive society — and we hope you’ll join us on the
          journey.
