          <h3>üì± Introducing Our Mobile App</h3>
          <p>
            We‚Äôre developing a user-friendly app that maps out
            wheelchair-accessible locations, step-free entrances, and other
            inclusive features. Our goal is to reduce uncertainty and support
            greater independence for everyone navigating the built environment.
